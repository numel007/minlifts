# Usage

1. Download the zip, unpack, and open index.html
2. Choose an exercise from the dropdown menu
3. Enter weight and reps while using "add set" and "remove set" buttons as needed
4. Use "calculate average" button to display average weight lifted per rep as well as total weight and reps completed.
5. For rest timer; enter desired minutes and seconds in corresponding input boxes, then click "start timer" button. Do not click more than once. There are bugs. So many bugs.
6. To reset timer, reload the page. A fix is in the works.

# Purpose

MinLifts is a web app designed to help users quickly and efficiently track their workouts, primarily focused around resistance training. Input fields for exercises, sets, reps, and weight lifted are available.

Buttons to create and remove sets have been implemented as well as a button to calculate average weight lifted over all repetitions. A basic rest timer has also been built in but functionality is currently limited and there are a few bugs to work out.

MinLifts was created out of necessity. I have been weight training for a little while and always found the available tracking apps to be overly bloated or far too complicated to use in the middle of a difficult set. The goal with MinLifts is to create an application that requires no explanation and requires minimal input to function. Less is more.
